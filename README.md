# WebScraping
Basics of Web Scraping with Python

The jupyter notebooks display simple methods to perform webscraping using the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- Requests
- BeautifulSoap

# The Python library Pandas
Pandas makes it easy to scrape a table (<table> tag) on a web page. After obtaining it as a DataFrame, it is of course possible to do various processing and save it as an Excel file or csv file.

# The Python library Requests
Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. Thereâ€™s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to urllib3.

# The Python library BeautifulSoap
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.
